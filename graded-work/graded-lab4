format-time 3/ 5 ;;grader: do not use substring. It will return substring errors.
Perhaps using local and defining three numbers: minute digit as (exact-floor (/ millis 1000 60)), second digit as (remainder (quotient millis 1000) 60), and ms as (remainder millis 1000) and then padding as appropriate would be a better approach.

mean-time 4/ 5 ;;grader: you want (exact-floor (round (/ (total-time race) (length race)))) instead so you don't have a rounding error
