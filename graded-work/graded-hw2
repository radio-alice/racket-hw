;; === correctness ===

;; - assign-plane                    5/ 6
;;     uses ordering of conditional
;;     clauses to avoid specifying
;;     both upper and lower bound?
;;     prepends "Recommendation: " <<<
;;     in one place rather than
;;     having many copies?

;; - miles-earned                    6/ 6

;; - passengers                      6/ 6
;; - combine-flights                 6/ 6
;; - can-fit?                        6/ 6
;; - max-premium?                    6/ 6
;; - upgrade                         9/ 9
;;      works off of total
;;      number of
;;      passengers to
;;      simplify
;;      calculation?
;; NO: but clever approach nonetheless
;; - seats->letters                  6/ 6
;;      helper function for error
;;      checking?  NO               -1
